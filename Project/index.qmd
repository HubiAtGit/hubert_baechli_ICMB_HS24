First and foremost, the disdribution of information and knowledge should have something to do with learning. So I start with an exponential learning curve, which is easy to implement.

The basic idea is that when two agents meet, they learn together. Later, this should happen in a network. In the beginning, I will let the agents meet randomly in the population to see if the implementation of joint learning works.
